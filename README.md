Homie is a mobile application for finding your future roommates or/and soulmate. We focus on students who want to find a perfect person to share a room with in the future. Our app is the best platform for looking for other students' shared accommodation offers as well as for posting your own offer. Thanks to Homie you can find a roommate that matches your hobbies and interests and that you certainly will get along with.
